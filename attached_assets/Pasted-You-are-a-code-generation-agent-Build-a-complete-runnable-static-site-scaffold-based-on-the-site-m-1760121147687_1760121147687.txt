You are a code generation agent. Build a complete, runnable static-site scaffold based on the site map below. Use Eleventy (11ty) with Nunjucks templates. Produce a clean, accessible, mobile‑first layout with consistent navigation and metadata. Everything must be internal-link friendly and match the .html URLs specified.

====================
REQUIREMENTS
====================
1) Stack
- Use Node + Eleventy (11ty) with Nunjucks.
- Output directory: _site. Source directory: src.
- Use shared layout and partials for header, footer, and SEO tags.
- Include simple, readable CSS (no frameworks) with a responsive layout and accessible color contrast. Use system fonts.

2) URL strategy
- Provide BOTH:
  a) index page (/) as canonical home, AND
  b) legacy alias /home.html.
- Every page in the site map must exist with the exact .html filename shown (e.g., /services.html, /profiles.html, etc.).
- Security Consulting exists at /security-consulting.html but is not in the top nav; it should be discoverable from /services.html.

3) Navigation
- Top nav items: Home, Services, Profiles, Resources, Contact.
- Active state styling for the current page.
- Footer includes business name, placeholder addresses, licensing placeholders, and a copyright year that auto-updates.

4) Accessibility & SEO
- Each page has: unique <title>, meta description derived from the site map’s “description”, canonical link, Open Graph basics, and landmark regions.
- All images (use placeholders) have descriptive alt text placeholders.
- Skip-to-content link and keyboard-accessible nav.

5) Plumbing & QA
- Include robots.txt, humans.txt, and a generated sitemap.xml.
- Add a link-check script that validates internal links after build.
- Add a README with quick start, structure overview, and how to add new pages.
- Add a JSON file (src/_data/routes.json) mirroring the site map for programmatic nav generation and future automation.

Populate key files with the following:

package.json (use latest stable versions):
{
  "name": "millergroup-site",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "eleventy --serve --port=3000",
    "build": "eleventy",
    "check:links": "npx linkinator _site --recurse --skip 'mailto:,tel:' --silent"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@11ty/eleventy": "^2.0.0",
    "linkinator": "^4.0.0"
  }
}

.replit:
run = "npm run dev"

.eleventy.js:
- Input dir: "src"
- Output dir: "_site"
- Includes dir: "src/_includes"
- Add passthrough copy for "src/assets"
- Add a universal Nunjucks filter or shortcode to mark active nav items by comparing page.url

src/_data/site.json:
{
  "name": "MILLERGROUP Intelligence, Inc.",
  "tagline": "Private Investigation & Process Service",
  "baseUrl": "/",
  "contact": {
    "email": "info@example.com",
    "phone": "(555) 555-5555",
    "address": "Park City, UT — Placeholder",
    "licenses": ["CA #######", "UT #######", "MT #######"]
  },
  "social": {},
  "year": ""
}

src/_data/routes.json:
- Serialize the SITE MAP above into a compact JSON array with fields: url, title, description.
- Use these to generate nav and meta descriptions.

src/_includes/layouts/base.njk:
- HTML5 structure with lang="en", viewport, charset
- <title>{{ title }} | {{ site.name }}</title>
- <meta name="description" content="{{ description | safe }}">
- Canonical link that resolves to the page’s permalink
- OG tags (title, description)
- Header with logo text and nav created from routes.json top-level pages
- Skip-to-content link before header
- <main id="content">{{ content | safe }}</main>
- Footer with company name, licenses from site.json, and {{ site.year or current year }}

Each page file:
- Front matter: layout: "layouts/base.njk", title, description, permalink matching the .html name
- H1 matches title
- Short stub content derived from the “description” in the site map
- Internal links:
  - services.njk links to /security-consulting.html
  - profiles.njk links to each team bio page
  - resources.njk: include a list of external items as placeholders; mark them clearly with rel="nofollow noopener" and target="_blank". Do not include them in internal link checks.

Index vs home:
- index.njk: permalink: "/"
- home.njk: permalink: "/home.html"
- Both share the same content via an include to avoid duplication.

404.njk:
- permalink: "/404.html"
- Friendly message and a link back to "/"

robots.txt:
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: /sitemap.xml

sitemap.xml.njk:
- Loop over routes.json and emit <url><loc> absolute paths only for internal pages

assets/css/styles.css:
- Base typography, layout container, responsive nav, visible focus states, skip-link styles, .active class for nav

assets/js/main.js:
- Minimal mobile menu toggler
- No third-party dependencies

README.md:
- Quick start:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev (serve on port 3000)
  - npm run build
  - npm run check:links (checks internal links in _site)
- Structure explanation and how to add a new page (create .njk with front matter and add to routes.json)

====================
PAGE SPECS (TITLES, PERMALINKS, CONTENT STUBS)
====================
Create the following pages with these exact permalinks and titles. Use the provided description for the meta description and a short intro paragraph under the H1.

- index.njk  -> permalink "/"
  title: "Private Investigator & Process Service"
  also create home.njk -> permalink "/home.html" with same content
- services.njk -> "/services.html"
  title: "Services"
  include internal link to "/security-consulting.html"
- profiles.njk -> "/profiles.html"
  title: "Profiles"
  list and link to the three bios below
- bruce-thomas.njk -> "/bruce-thomas.html"
  title: "Bruce Thomas"
- scott-devereaux.njk -> "/scott-devereaux.html"
  title: "Scott Devereaux"
- michael-miller.njk -> "/michael-miller.html"
  title: "Michael Miller"
- resources.njk -> "/resources.html"
  title: "Resources"
  render external links as a simple list with external indicators (do not include them in sitemap.xml)
- contact.njk -> "/contact.html"
  title: "Contact"
- security-consulting.njk -> "/security-consulting.html"
  title: "Security Consulting"

====================
QUALITY BAR / DEFINITION OF DONE
====================
- Project installs and runs with `npm install` then `npm run dev` in Replit.
- All pages above build to _site with correct .html filenames.
- Top nav highlights the current page.
- Sitemap and robots generated.
- `npm run check:links` passes for all internal links.
- No console errors; HTML validates; basic accessibility checks pass (headings order, alt attributes present, focus visible).
