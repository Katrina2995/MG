        <h3>Reality TV</h3>
        <div class="card-description" hidden>
          <p><strong>Consultation</strong> - to frame our client's expectations as to public vs. private information sources, the availability and accuracy of relevant data and other records, third party response time, and jurisdictional considerations. In addition, we develop a sense of our client's budget, time considerations, and any other issues affecting the process. We then work together with our clients and their attorneys to create an investigation plan to meets their needs.</p>
          <p><strong>Control Applications</strong> - to expedite the investigation process and increase research accuracy. Based on the ideal applicant profile, we provide information as to the availability of information to assess persons with specific educational, professional, and occupational backgrounds. In addition, we assist in preparing control questions that maximize response information and address multiple areas that might be precluded if posed by third parties. This is one of the most important, yet often overlooked assets to the due diligence process.</p>
          <p><strong>Selecting Areas of Inquiry</strong> - to ensure our clients are fully informed as to all relevant areas of inquiry available to them. Clearly, the areas of interest regarding persons who will be performing a single stunt during a half-hour program will be less than for persons who will be aired daily or weekly over a season and/or who will be living together in a moderately supervised environment.</p>

        <h3>Due Diligence</h3>
        <div class="card-description" hidden>
          <p>In the area of individual due diligence, our clients regularly request investigations to assess the following issues:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>External candidates seeking high-stakes internal positions.</li>
            <li>Internal executives seeking promotions to more sensitive posts.</li>
            <li>Sub-contractor consultants working on temporary, yet information sensitive projects.</li>
            <li>Applicants for placement in reality television productions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In many cases, our investigations have substantiated claims of individual integrity and corporate stability. In others, we have developed evidence revealing undisclosed civil litigation, criminal histories, conflict of interest activities, financial instability, inflated assets, hidden liabilities, and overall questionable business practices.</p>
          <p><strong>Some of our more commonly requested due diligence services are:</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Pre-Employment and Executive Audit Investigations</strong> - In depth customized background investigations to assist in pre-employment, pre-promotion, and interim evaluations involving high level, sensitive positions.</p>
          <p><strong>Television Production Risk Assessment and Mitigation</strong> - Customized background investigation programs to assist in the evaluation of persons seeking to participate as contestants, guests, and performers on reality based programs and various talk show formats. MILLERGROUP's efforts in this area have been instrumental in reducing the risk of negative publicity and financial liability to both networks and production companies.</p>

        <h3>TSCM</h3>
        <div class="card-description" hidden>
          <p><strong>Technical Surveillance Countermeasures</strong></p>
          <p>The use of electronic surveillance to commit economic espionage has been a rapidly growing trend. Covert information gathering has been documented in both business and residential environments, targeting corporate executives as well as those in communication with them. We have even uncovered evidence of listening devices and video surveillance equipment in five-star hotel rooms, in vehicles, and on aircraft.</p>
          <p>To help mitigate the risk of unwittingly supplying confidential, proprietary information, MILLERGROUP "TSCM" experts utilize state of the art countermeasures equipment to reveal covertly placed, information-gathering items. In addition, we regularly provide privacy/information security assessments to assist clients in reducing the risk of future intrusions.</p>
